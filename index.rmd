### Bio

I am a PhD student in psychology bridging the gap between human cognition and modern technology. My work lies at the intersection of cognitive psychology, human-computer interaction (HCI), and artificial intelligence. 

My primary research and dissertation focus on the underlying mechanisms of **attentional choice**—understanding how we process information and interact with complex systems.

### Technical Toolkit

To design experiments, collect behavioral data, and run advanced statistical models, I rely on a robust technical stack:
* **R & Python**
* **MATLAB & Psychtoolbox**

### Beyond the Lab

When I am not coding or analyzing data, I am usually tending to the ecosystem in my planted aquarium or planning my next travel adventure.
